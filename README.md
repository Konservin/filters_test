Features:

5. Add new criteria to new or existing filters
6. Delete criteria from new or existing filters

8. Toggle criteria subtype and value depending on criteria type

Issues:
1. Can add any number of filters with the same name
2. Saving filter with no criteria redirects to non-modal form
3. Scrolling of form elements not supported in non-modal form (not requested in task specs, not critical)
4. Native bootstrap datepicker is not too aesthetical, needs restyling
